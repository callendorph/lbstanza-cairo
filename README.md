# Stanza wrapper for LibCairo

This provides a wrapper for the cross-platform drawing library libcairo. See https://www.cairographics.org/ for more info.

## Run the Tests

Easy way is to use the docker container:

```bash
$> ./run_tests.sh
```

This will build a container `lbstanza-cairo:latest` and then
run the unit tests in that container.
